 TODO List for WCHAR_UTF16 Library
-----------------------------------

* The wide character encoding in the current implementation is actually UCS-2 rather than UTF-16.
  To make it the same as on Windows wide character conversion functions must be extended.

* UTF-8 encoding is used for multibyte strings regardless of the locale settings.
  The setlocale() function and its dependencies must be enabled for compilation.
  However original source code from FreeBSD uses different locale data files (located in /usr/share/locale/ directory).
  So these data files must be created using mklocale tool and corresponding locale sources from BSD distribution.
  Also client code should set $PATH_LOCALE environment variable to proper directory.

* Add exhaustive tests for each public function

* Add x86_64 support.
  
* Add COPYING or LICENSE file
